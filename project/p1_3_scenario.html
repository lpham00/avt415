				<dd>Clark is a popcorn fiend whose favorite local popcorn store has recently closed down. He has been looking for a store that sells his favorite flavor, along with the more unusual flavors. Clark finds the Pop and Pop’s Popcorn website. He browses through the best-selling category and to his surprise, his favorite flavor is among the top best-selling popcorn flavors! After looking through reviews and various different flavors, he eventually caves in and buys himself the popcorn.
